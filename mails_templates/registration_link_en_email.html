                            <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Enclosed you will find the link to get accredited for the Bad Homburg Open 2023. Please ensure that all requests for the required accreditations are sent by June 14, 2023 at 12:00 pm to ensure timely review and approval.</p>
                            <ul style="margin-bottom:15px;list-style-type: circle;">
                              <li>For each company, we collect the data of a main contact person as well as the data of the staff needed on site. Please do not forget to accredit yourself if you need accreditation. If the main contact person will perform the accreditation registration for all staff members, it is necessary to check the last box to "create an extended administrator account".</li>
                              <li>One step of this year's accreditation process is that all persons or The Admins have read and accepted the following documents: a) Data Protection Policy, b) Consent to the creation, processing and publication of photo/video recordings, c) Brief information on Occupational Health and Safety.</li>
                              <li>For additional quality assurance, it is necessary that you, as the main person in charge, review and manage all accreditation requests from your team. For this purpose, after registration, an additional admin view will be unlocked for you in your account. All active accreditation requests (status = pending) will be considered in the further approval process.</li>
                              <li>On site, the presentation of a valid photo ID is mandatory to receive the accreditation - no exceptions will be made and persons without ID will be rejected.</li>
                              <li>There will be longer waiting times in front of the accreditation office during peak hours. Therefore, be sure to arrive on time and allow sufficient time. We recommend arriving at least two hours before a possible assignment or appointment. Again, please be sure to bring photo identification - and pass this along to all your colleagues.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Please share the following link with all your colleagues to complete the required accreditations:</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom:30px">${company_link.value}</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom:15px">Important: after creating your account it may take up to 24h until your admin view is activated. Please reload your browser window if necessary for this.</p>
                            <p>With kind regards,<br>
                              The Accreditation Team</p>
